Ethereum has the greatest chance for success

Stats:
* Most Active Developers
* Most Interesting Projects
* The most innovative smart contracts
* One of the highest continuous market caps
* The most optimism in it's future

Ethereum Foundation:
* Active in all aspects of dapp framework
* Extensive research in scalability, privacy, and security
* Major enterprise partners
* One of the brightest minds in crypto

Plus, *Ethereum* just sounds cool!

What if we're wrong?
* Skills and Knowledge transfer to competitors
* Only differences are underlying tradeoffs and programming language
* Develop discipline in development transferrable to other fields

+++

Our primary reason we believe Ethereum is the best framework to develop with
is that it has the greatest chance of success in the long term.

It has the most developer talent,
the most active, interesting projects,
the widest use of smart contracts,
one of the highest continuous market caps of any cryptocurrency,
and by far the most optimism for the future (in my opinion).

Ethereum is very, very active in the development of all aspects
the dapp framework and ensuring that it is made possible,
with active research and extensive funding from the Ethereum Foundation,
major enterprise partners like Consensys, Microsoft, and Intel from the EEA,
and one of the brightest minds in the space at the helm of it all.

Plus, *Ethereum* just sounds cool!

Even if Ethereum isn't ultimately the blockchain to rule all blockchains,
the skills and knowledge needed to learn distributed application development
will be transferable to whatever competitors come into existence.
The major differences between Ethereum and other smart contract frameworks
are simply the underlying tradeoffs use to secure the blockchain,
and what programming language you use to write the smart contracts.

So, what is Ethereum? First a little back story...

Ethereum originated from a young Russian-Canadian programmer named Vitalik Buterin.
Vitalik's father had introduced Buterin to Bitcoin in 2012 at age 17,
and he became obsessed with cryptocurrencies.
In 2013, after working with several other prominent cryptocurrency developers
and thought-leaders all over the world, he returned home to work on the Ethereum Whitepaper
after identifying a need to create a cryptocurrency with a general-purpose scripting language
following his work on MasterCoin.

After publishing the paper, at the age of 19 he dropped out of college
at the University of Waterloo when he received a $100,000 Thiel Fellowship grant.
He formed a development group with a team of 3 other developers,
and by mid-2014 it became clear that the idea should move forward.
They formed a non-profit entity in Switzerland and raised $20m in Bitcoin
to fund the development of the Ethereum platform.

By May of the following year, Ethereum had released it's first public beta,
offering 25k Ether rewards for stress testing the network.
In March 2016, Ethereum had it's first public release,
including improvements to transaction processing, gas pricing, and security.

]

???

Following the success of the first public release,
Ethereum formed a Decentralized Autonomous Organization called The DAO,
which was a set of smart contracts intended to invest into the burgeoning Ethereum ecosystem.
It raised a record $150m in it's crowd-sale (15% of all Ether),
and is often referred to as the first ICO.

Following the success of that crowd-sale, hackers hacked the smart contracts used by The DAO
to steal 3.6m Ether from the newly-founded organization.
Since the funds were put into a 28-day escrow before they were to be released,
the Ethereum community came together to discuss what to do about the impending hack.

Ultimately, in a contentious hard-fork off-shooting what is now Ethereum Classic,
the Ethereum community reversed The DAO Hack and returned all investor funds.
This is widely credited as the first real test of the Ethereum community,
a test many consider to have been appropriately handled given the circumstances.
Since the resolution of The DAO hack, the price of Ethereum has been on the rise,
fueling the growth of the overall platform in the global cryptocurrency community.

2017 was a wild year for Ethereum.
The Ethereum Platform was the basis for over 200 ICOs raising more than $3b.
The Ethereum Enterprise Alliance added 86 technology companies, including many large companies.
It increased the amount of transactions very close to it's limit,
with the CryptoKitties project in Dec 2017 ultimately causing a huge network slowdown showing
the limits of the platform in it's current state.

2018 is going to be an interesting year for Ethereum.
Casper, the PoS upgrade, has recently gone into Beta Testing, and is anticipated to
largely eliminate the environmental impact of mining and reduce confirmation times.
Sharding and the Plasma framework are new methods for Ethereum to increase
it's transaction capacity and are currently under active research,
with prototypes slated for later this year.

Now, what exactly *is* Ethereum?

# What is Ethereum?

Well, it is a blockchain. [hilarity ensues]

Ethereum keeps all transactions on a public, immutable ledger

Ethereum transactions execute data instead of transfer ownership of a coin

*A Blockchain is:*
* Transactions into blocks
* Newest block linked to one before it
* All parties come to consensus on linking
* If a link is modified, all parties know it

Transactions change Ethereum's "state"

All parties know the rules in smart contracts,
and new smart contracts are also known to all parties.

Ethereum is more than a blockchain

+++

Ethereum stores transactions on an immutable ledger, basically like any other blockchain.

What makes Ethereum special is that the transactions aren't simply the transfer of a coin,
but the execution of pre-programmed computer logic statements called Smart Contracts,
which can transfer valuable assets of any type or specification over a common framework.

For those who haven't learned too much about blockchains, a brief description:
A blockchain stores a series of transactions into blocks,
where each block is linked to the previous through network consensus rules.
Any modification of a "link" in the chain would be detectable,
so all other parties would know a change was made,
and can handle it appropriately.

Each of these transactions progresses the "state" of Ethereum, moving valuable assets
between parties by executing smart contracts (which are themselves stored in the "state").
Since all parties know and trust the rules by which smart contracts are executed,
they can trust that the "state" has been correctly maintained.

Since Ethereum transactions are more than simple transfers of assets in a distributed ledger,
you can think of Ethereum as more than a blockchain.

.right-column.width-75[
The World's Largest and Most Expensive Computing Device

Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Specs:
* Stack, 1024 stack limit
* Memory, 256-bit registers, max governed by gas limit
* Storage, unlimited ($$$), stored per Smart Contract
* Block Gas Limit, currently approx 7 million gas

Ethereum is a world-computer

Every transaction is processed by EVM, Ethereum's computer

EVM runs on every node concurrently, part of consensus protocol

EVM is a Turing Machine, suffers Halting Problem

Solution is Gas:
* Each instruction costs gas to execute
* A transaction has a limit on computation -- gas limit
* Gas remaining is refunded
* If all gas used up, transaction fails
* Fee is gas used times gas price, and given to the miner
* Failed transaction still pays fee

Miners choose block gas limit, amount of gas used by all transactions in block

High cost, only store important data and smart contracts

Be smart!

+++

You could also think of Ethereum as a computer that is shared by the world.

Every transaction that is stored in the blockchain is processed by the Ethereum
Virtual Machine, a simple computing device that determines the "state" of Ethereum.
The EVM is run on every node of the network concurrently, such that
each transaction results in the exact same modification of the underlying state
no matter what implementation of the node software is used.
Since the "state" itself is one of the parameters logged in the block by the miners,
all parties agree that the state is consistent when they come to consensus via mining.

Because the EVM is a Turing Machine, it suffers from the Halting problem,
which means it's not possible to tell if a transaction will be computable in a finite amount of time.
This means it would be possible to stop the network from processing transactions,
and result in a denial of service.
To solve this, and many other potential attacks, Ethereum introduces the concept of Gas.

For every instruction executed in a transaction, "Gas" is charged according the resources
used, whether it be computing cycles, memory storage, or storage to the global data store.
The miners decide what they want the "gas price" to be in order to collect fees from processing
a transaction, this not only prevents the attacks from occurring, but rewards the miners for
their activity. Every user that sends a transaction is expected to pay a fee to get it accepted,
and that fee is transferred to the miner regardless of the success of the transaction.

The miners also agree on a gas limit, which is the total amount of gas a transaction can use.
Exceeding this limit will also fail the transaction, resulting in the miner getting all of
fees no matter what happens.

Due to these costs, it is only useful to store small programs and limited data "on-chain",
so a Dapp Developer must be very smart in determining what code and data is important enough
to live in Ethereum, and when to store it elsewhere.

# What is Ethereum?

1. It's a blockchain

A Turing-complete database for the Decentralized Web!

???

Ethereum is the backend database of the decentralized web

Ethereum is ACID compliant:
* Applied atomically -- "all or nothing"
    * If it fails, it fails everywhere
    * No state modifications
* Consistently applied -- everyone agrees on rules
    * Smart contracts modify rules consistently
* Transactions are isolated -- no txn dependancies
    * Order is important...
* Durable, thanks to the blockchain! -- massively redundant
    * Uptime is 100%!

+++

In my opinion, the best way to think of Ethereum is a really interesting back-end database 
for decentralized applications.
Like most databases, Ethereum is ACID compliant,
meaning transactions are Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable

When a transaction is sent, it is applied atomically.
In Ethereum, this means if a transaction fails because it runs out of gas
or encounters an exception, then the transaction does not change the overall state.
All nodes process this transaction together, so the transaction is applied
"all or nothing" if confirmed by the network.

Since every node agrees to the underlying rules to participate in the network,
and how those rules are changed or extended through Smart Contracts,
that means that every transaction is "consistently" applied and no node will
disagree on the state.

Each transaction is applied in the order it was received, and since each
node is synchronized by block, all transactions are applied independently
and do not affect each other.
That is not to say that the order of the transactions is not important,
but that all nodes agree on the order of the transactions and how to apply them.

Lastly, thanks to the durability of the network, if even one of the
tens of thousands of Ethereum nodes is still up and running, then the network
is live and doesn't lose data. The up-time of Ethereum is almost 100%!

# Economics in Ethereum

<br><br>

It really works because of Economics (*Cryptoeconomics*)

*Cryptoeconomics*:
Designing economic mechanisms to control user behavior without explicit rules

Ethereum uses Cryptoeconomics:
* Mining incentives -- block reward + fees
* Gas limit

Dapps need Cryptoeconomics:
* Protect against abusive behavior
* Reward good behavior
* Bots -- Sybil attack (many acconuts, 1 owner)
* Whales -- undue influence of economically advantaged individuals

Economics drives programming dapps:
* Non-optimal designs are costly
* Mistakes are costly
* Users won't tolerate many mistakes, so reduce risk of hack

Cryptoeconomics is the most important outcome of blockchain tech

We control the rules of the digital economy!

+++

What makes Ethereum really work though is economics, or *CryptoEconomics* as we like to call it.
CryptoEconomics is the process of designing economic incentives in order to reward good behaviors,
and punish bad behaviors, on a blockchain network.

For example, the consensus and mining processes for adding to the blockchain are secured
using a combination of different incentives including fees and the block reward.

Similarly, decentralized applications need to make use of economic incentives to ensure
their features are robust against attacks from bad actors in the system.

This might mean having a fee to protect against spam from a bot-net,
or adding a staking mechanism to protect against whales having undue influence.

Economics also dictate HOW you code.
Identifying risk and designing around it is a big part of designing in Ethereum.
You don't want hold vast amounts of funds in insecure smart contracts,
at least more than what anyone is willing to lose.

CryptoEconomics are probably the most exciting outcome of blockchain technology in general.
For the first time in history, we can write the rules of the digital economy!

Ethereum issues:
* Scalability
    * Sharding
    * Plasma
    * Casper (PoS) enables both solutions
* Privacy
    * Z-cash collab
    * Protect vulnerable populations
    * Tricky balance -- transparency vs. privacy
* Smart Contract Security
    * $1b lost (at $1k Ether)
    * Vyper -- Python, more secure by design
    * Solidity was great, but has major flaws
    * Tools needed in the ecosystem to help support
    * Formal Verification

+++

The future of Ethereum is very bright, but there are some problem areas that are in work.

Currently, the Ethereum network has a theoretical limit of 15 transactions/sec,
which is much less than the 45k txns/sec that payment processors like Visa can manage,
and far, far less than what would be needed to enable general-purpose dapps.
Initiates like Sharding and Proof of Stake are intended to reduce the costs,
both economic and computational, with running the Ethereum network, as well as
improve the transaction bandwidth to the level required to handle the demand of a
universe full of dapps.
Proof of Stake also has the nice side effect of nearly eliminating the environmental impacts
of safeguarding blockchain networks, the emissions of which, by 2020, will be more than
an industrialized western nation like Denmark.

In order to protect the privacy and security of the general population,
there needs to be a reasonable means of making private transactions.
For vulnerable populations like refugees and citizens of authoritarian regimes
this is especially important, with key members of the community promoting this
as one of the primary needs of users of this technology.
Recently, the Ethereum community was able to integrate the technology behind
privacy-focused cryptocurrency Z-cash, which is called zk-SNARKS or "zero-knowledge proofs",
and send a private transaction that is secured by the public Ethereum network.
Future collaborations of this type are becoming increasingly important to the project.

Lastly, as some of you may know, there are big problems with Solidity,
the Smart Contract language Ethereum currently uses to create Dapps.
Almost a billion dollars of funds (at a Ether price of $1000) were lost since the project's inception,
a frankly unsustainable amount of money for the platform to be successful in the long term.
While Solidity was successful in getting web developers on board early in the project's life,
security-orientated languages (like Vyper) will need to be developed that mitigate many of the
issues that have been discovered with smart contracts, and allow developers to create safe, optimal
contracts for their Dapps with minimal hassle and special knowledge.
