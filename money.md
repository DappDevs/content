# Is Bitcoin Money?

.left-column.width-66[

*Yes, it's magic digital money!*

*But, what does that mean?*

*Well, money is a...*
* Store of Value
* Unit of Account
* Medium of Exchange

*But, can't anyone create their own Bitcoin?*

*Yes... that doesn't mean anyone cares.*

### It's all about the network!

*Wait, there's phyisical Bitcoins?*

*I thought you said it was digital?*

People always ask "Is Bitcoin Money?"

Most people in the know usually answer that money is a...
* Unit of Account
    * Anyone can get a Bitcoin address and have Bitcoin
* Store of Value
    * Well, *some* value. It fluctuates...
* Medium of exchange
    * You have to pay a fee, but... kind of works.

Those definitions are important, but I like this one:

*Money is a tool to signal value across an economic network*

# Money is a Technology

.left-column.width-66[

A really powerful one:
* Probably as old as fire
* Facilitates trade
* Integral to our daily experience
* Allows us to operate outside of small communities

But it only works if:
* The currency is scarce
* It is fungible ($1 == $1)
* It is not easy to counterfeit

*That's why governments control it*

Or, if we summarize further, "Money is a Technology"

It's a technology nearly as old as humanity itself.

Someone, somewhere, sometime:
* made funny shapes
* on round pieces of metal
* and traded it for a cow

Then that person traded it for a goat

This is basically how modern civilization started

As it got more usage, someone...
* made a bunch of their own money
* using some *other* metal
* and made themselves rich

Then the governments
* got involved
* put their own funny shape on it
* and declared it soverign currency.

And counterfeiting was punishable by death.

# Is Ethereum Just Money Too?

.left-column.width-66[

*No!*
 
Ethereum is a platform that allows you to create your own money!

...as well as other valuable digital assets and agreements:
* Tokens
* ICOs
* Dapps
* DAOs

It has a native coin called *ether*, required to execute transactions

Well, so what about Ethereum?

Is it just money too?

Ethereum does have a native crypto, but:
* is a generalized application framework
* basically lets you make your own money easily
* as well as other valuable assets and agreements

Early innovations of Ethereum:
* Tokens (ERC-20 Standard)
* ICOs (Crowdsale events)
* Dapps (May use Tokens for operation)
* DAOs (May use Tokens to enable governance)

# Ethereum is a *network* of Money!

.left-column.width-50[

Anyone can make a token... but, who cares?

The network cares... about use cases!
* Utility tokens
    * Access to a resource
    * Debt
    * Fees
    * Licenses
* Security tokens
    * DAO voting rights
    * Collatoralized debt
* Collectibles
    * Digital collectibles
    * Phyiscal collectibles (certificates)
* [insert yours here]

Value in Ethereum == value in the real world

aka Use Cases

Plenty of examples, just find them!

The network will reward you buy using your dapp

This increases it's value, increasing it's adoption

Virtuous cycle

*BUT* it's all rooted in doing something *USEFUL*

# Sign me up!

.left-column.width-66[
There's no secret to magic internet money...

It still requires:
* Solving problems
* Hard work
* Listening
* Transparency
* Communication
* Marketing
* ...and a little bit of luck!

But first and foremost, you have to `#BUIDL` the thing!

So, you might be saying to yourself

"Where do I sign up?? How do I make millions and buy myself a Lambo??"

Well, prepare to be dissapointed!

Ethereum projects are open source

You're not selling software...

You're selling a solution!

And a network of people who find that solution useful

And that's hard work...

But ultimately rewarding, literally!

This goes double for Ethereum itself

If we don't show that the platform solves real problems...

Then your Crypto is worthless
