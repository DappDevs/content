# Blockchain Use Case: Gun Ownership

Conflicting Demands:
* Police need data to track guns used in crime
    * Often impossible to find ownership records
* Gun owners don't want to share that data
    * Privacy & 2nd Amendment Rights
    * Avoid mass surveilance

Problems:
* Gun show loophole
* 3rd party sales
* KYC compliance

Solutions:
* Allow ZK proof of ownership transfer
    * Last revealed owner can show transfer
    * No mass survailence allowed
    * Gives law enforcement tools
* Unlinkable accounts
    * Guns are tokens
    * Owners are secret until revealed

*We are working on this with GunClear!*
